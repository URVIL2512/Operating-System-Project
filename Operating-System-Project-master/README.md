# OperatingSystemProject
This repository contains implementations of several key components of operating systems: Priority Preemptive CPU Scheduling, Reader-Writer Problem using Semaphores, FCFS Disk Scheduling, and LRU Page Replacement Algorithm. These implementations serve as practical exercises to understand and implement fundamental concepts in operating systems.
